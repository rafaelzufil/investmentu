## OpenX Userguides

- The OpenX system will be organized using the built in Website and Zone system.  This system gives the users the ability to restrict an ad based on a zone within a website.  So if the user wants to display an ad only on one website they can add that ad only to the website that is to display it.  Using the same logic, if the user has an ad they want displayed on all websites, they can add the ad to all websites in the proper sized zones.  This will make organization extremely easy to understand, and give the user the easy ability to see what websites a certain ad has been added to.

### OpenX Content Delegation Functionality

- This functionality will help us influence OpenX in what ads should be served by generating a list of keywords that OpenX can use to apply as a filter in what advertisements to choose. The functionality will take in to account the user's current subscriptions, the page context (tags and categories) as well as provide the ability for each site to add tags of its own.
