## CF Context

The CF Context plugin gathers data about the page being displayed, including author, categories and tags, and passes that information on to any plugin that desires it.  The plugin is also filterable so plugins/themes may pass in their own Context to be passed along.

### Display

To view the context for a specific page, add `?cfcn_display=true` to the end of the URL and scroll to the bottom of the page to view the Context being generated.
